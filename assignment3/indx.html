    <title>Time Observer</title>
    <!-- 
    "Time Observer" is an interactive web-based artwork where the user does not control time 
    but instead exists as a silent observer of its flow. Centered around the themes of memory, 
    pain, and healing, the project allows users to click and drag to leave visual traces on 
    the screen—deep red wounds that fade slowly or poetic phrases like "the time will heal 
    your pain" that gently drift away. These interactions symbolize the emotional marks time 
    leaves behind and how they eventually dissolve. A minimal interface, with a dark background 
    and crosshair cursor, positions the user as a detached witness, while glowing red horizontal 
    lines scroll downward to represent the linear passage of time. A live digital clock at the 
    center reinforces the immediacy of the present moment. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and 
    JavaScript, the piece avoids external libraries to preserve full creative control. 
    "Time Observer" invites reflection on how we engage with the intangible flow of time—not 
    by holding onto it, but by simply noticing it as it slips through our fingers.
